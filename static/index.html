    <h1>Hello From Server!</h1>
    <p>
      This HTML file was served from an HTTP server that was written from
      scratch! Everything in this site is styled using CSS which is served by
      our http server!
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <a href="/does-not-exist" class="error-link">here</a> to go to a
      route that doesn't exist.
    </p>
    <img src="/image.png" alt="Internet Icon PNG" />
    <img src="/flowers.jpeg" alt="Flower Image JPG" />
    <p>
      The static images above are also hosted by and fetched from the server.
      Moreover, the <a href="/image.png">Internet image</a> is a png, while the
      <a href="/flowers.jpeg">flower image</a> is jpg.
    </p>
    <p><a href="/data.json">JSON</a>? No problem! <button id="alert-button">JavaScript?</button> Also no problem!</p>
    <p>
      If you're interested in the HTTP protocol, try reading up on the
      <a href="/rfc2616.pdf">RFC.</a> (also hosted on the server). Note that
      fetching larger PDFs may have noticeable latency.
